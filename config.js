  subtitle: `Hi. I'm a front-end web developer based in the Midlands, UK. I sometimes write about my experiences in the tech industry, offer ad-hoc thought pieces and generally make comment on my life's agenda. I built this website using Gatsby - it's became a playground for me to write code and experiment ideas. I have a keen enthusiasm to keep things fully accessible and friendly here. I'm a hyper sensitive person myself and so this website has been designed with every intention to make it easy on the eyes and light on the cognition. So without further ado, welcome to my place on the web that I like to call home.`,
