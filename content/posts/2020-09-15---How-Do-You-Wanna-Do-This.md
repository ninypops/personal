There I was, searching the web for the perfect stack to build my new website but the truth is, there is no perfect stack. The next best thing is to make sure it's fun. There were many ways this could go and a few long nights down the rabbit hole that is the internet. Choices were plenty but there was only one way to settle this if I wanted a website up and running before the end of 2020!

#### **So, what was it going to be?**

Vue, React or straight up HTML5? Heroku, Gatsby or Next? Did I want a CMS or not? Templates or no templates?

Now, the truth is that I had already (kinda) made up my mind. The dealbreaker for me was being able to use ReactJS. I wanted this website to be a playground to learn and experiment with this particular JS library. Why? I had only been practising it for a year and there were a lot of knowledge gaps. I use it every day at work but within the context of the software that I'm developing and so I wanted to be able to build something a little more casual with a lot more liberties.

#### **The verdict.**

If you're reading this, you're looking at a website powered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

#### **My reasons why.**

I had briefly used Gatsby before and was satisfied with how quickly you can get something up and running with the framework. I chose to go with a Netlify CMS as I come from a background in Wordpress and enjoy the visual benefits of seeing my post previews before actually posting them. I figured Netlify CMS was going to be a lot more secure and lightweight than WP though due to it's JamStack technology. And you know the rest, I was super keen to use ReactJS in a more free and easy fashion, outside the obligations of work.

#### **The challenges:**

"*Quick and easy*", they said. "*You'll be up in no time*", they told me. And they were wrong every time. I feel like nothing is ever that simple with web technologies whether that be environment factors or lack of experience with a framework. There was one issue that cropped up but this was down to the lack of maintanance on the starter-theme that I had picked out from [Gatsby's Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/). Luckily, there was some chatter about this in the repo and so it wasn't difficult to resolve and I had my own website up and running in no time! Locally, at least. The rest was seamless. Netlify deployments work a treat and I'm really satisfied with the choices I made.

So, now that I've got a fully functioning website. What happens next? Well, my hope is to continue to write posts about my experiences as a front-end developer, ad-hoc life pieces and anything I think is worthy of noting. It is my playground, after all.
