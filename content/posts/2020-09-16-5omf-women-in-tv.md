> 5OMF is a blog series I started to occasionally highlight 5 things within a particular medium that I want to bring awareness to.

Thanks to COVID-19 measures, we're spending an average of six hours and 25 minutes each day in front of a screen (source [independent.co.uk](independent.co.uk)) and have all the time in the world to pick up all of those TV shows we started months ago and never finished. *Can I get an "Amen"?*
