Contrary to popular beliefs, I'm not all that enthusiastic of dark modes in my IDE. Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with a light theme, except for the fact that your colleague will never stop roasting you for it. Whenever I'm peer programming, the first thing that my colleague remarks on isn't my code - it's the theme of my code editor. So, for my friends who consider themselves nocturnal or just prefer the visual prettiness of a dark mode, I'm happy to announce that my website now dons one.

What's encouraging is that there is increasingly more tools built into our software and browsers now that improve contrast and help to reduce eye strain. I've definitely benefited from using them. However, dark modes are no stranger to programmers. They've been around since the very beginning.
