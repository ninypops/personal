Hi there!

I'm Nina, and I'm a software developer at Adzooma.

I specialise in front-end-technologies, namely Javascript (ES6), React, HTML & CSS.

I lean towards projects that are centered around people and are socially conscientious. I like attending monthly tech events, hackathons and tech conferences in and around the UK.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually fighting my way through virtual (and real) world pandemics, going to live music events and hanging out at my favourite independent coffee shop.
