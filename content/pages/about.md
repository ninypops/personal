Hi there!

I'm Nina, and I'm a <strong>software developer</strong> at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adzooma.com">Adzooma</a>.

I specialise in front-end-technologies, namely Javascript, React, HTML & CSS.

I lean towards projects that are <strong>centered around people</strong> and are <strong>socially conscientious</strong>. I'm a <strong>homebody</strong> but still manage to attend monthly tech events, hackathons and tech conferences in and around the UK.

When I'm <strong>not</strong> writing code, I'm usually fighting my way through <strong>virtual (and real) world pandemics</strong>, going to <strong>live music events</strong> and hanging out at my favourite <strong>independent coffee shop</strong>.

*Welcome to my small home on the web.*
