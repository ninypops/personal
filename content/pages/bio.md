Hi there!

I'm Nina, and I'm a <strong>front-end developer</strong> specialising in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>.

I lean towards projects that are <strong>centered around people</strong> and are <strong>socially conscientious</strong>.

People are the most important part about working on a project, whether that be the team I'm working with or a client I'm building for. I aim to make projects that add value and benefit to the lives of others.

As a <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gitnation.org/">GitNation</a> Resident</strong>, I'm an avid tech conference attendee while also staying involved locally at meet-ups in and around my area.

When I'm <strong>not</strong> writing code, I'm usually fighting my way through <strong>virtual (and real) world pandemics</strong>, going to <strong>live music events</strong> and hanging out at my favourite <strong>independent coffee shop</strong>.

*Welcome to my small home on the web.*
